# DESIGN — proiect_web1

<!-- graffino-agentic:begin v1 -->
> The design guardrails for this app. Every UI change follows them. A change to a
> token or a rule here is a PROPOSAL (AGENTS.md → The gate).

## Where designs live
**Designs change only in this repo.** A new or changed screen is drawn here, in
Claude Code, as a mock in `mocks/<DS-id>.html` (using the tokens below), and
confirmed before it is built. The places:

| Place | Role | Updated |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/design/` (this repo) | the source: tokens, mocks, screenshots, registry | by Claude Code, in the repo |
| Design board (Source) | where people look at a design and confirm it | published from the repo, one way; never edited, never pulled back |
| Figma (Source, optional) | a snapshot for specific cases | regenerated only on request; can be behind |

When they disagree, the repo is right. A change made on the board or in Figma is lost
at the next publish. Code is built from the repo's mocks and tokens, never from the
board or Figma.

## Procedure for any UI change

1. **Find the design.** Resolve the screen's `DS-` ID in `registry.yaml` and open
   its mock (`mocks/`) and screenshots (`screens/`). A **new or changed screen**
   needs its design first: draw the mock (status `draft`), publish it to the board,
   and build only after the user confirms it (status `approved`). Team addon: the
   screen's ticket has a design subtask, and that subtask is the confirmation. Never
   extrapolate a screen.
2. **Reuse first.** Use an existing component from `registry.yaml` (kind
   `component`). A new component needs a reason in the plan.
3. **Tokens only.** Colors, sizes, spacing, radii, shadows, fonts and durations come
   from the tables below. No raw hex, px or font name in component code.
4. **Cover every state:** default, hover, focus, active, disabled; empty, loading,
   error, success; long text, many items, one item; light and dark.
5. **Screenshot and compare** (command in AGENTS.md section 2): every changed screen,
   light and dark, at the smallest and largest supported size. Save as
   `screens/<DS-id>.<light|dark>.png`. Look at each one before you report.
6. **Record.** Update `registry.yaml` (new DS- ID, status `implemented`, source
   file). Republish the changed screens to the board. A reusable UI practice becomes
   a `candidate` pattern.

## Guardrails

**Color and contrast**
- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (≥ 3:1 for text ≥ 18.66 px bold / 24 px). Icons, borders of
  inputs and focus rings ≥ 3:1 against their background. Check both themes.
- Color never carries meaning alone: pair it with an icon or text.
- Dark mode uses its own token values, not inverted light values.

**Typography**
- System font stack or standard web-safe fonts (`system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif`).
- Clear typographic hierarchy from heading to body text.

**Spacing & Layout**
- Consistent 4px / 8px grid (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 px).
- Responsive layouts adapting cleanly to mobile and desktop viewports.
